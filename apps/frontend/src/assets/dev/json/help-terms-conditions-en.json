  "p5": "Glossary",
  "p5_1": "Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules: “Single” – a bet on a single event;",
  "p5_1__1": "“Express” – this is a bet on the outcome of several different events simultaneously. When you place a bet on the outcome of two or more events (for example, two different football matches), you can unite them in “Express”. To win an express bet it is necessary for you to not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes which are included in the Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet means loss throughout the entire bet. Winnings of the express bets is equal the product of the bet amount at the coefficients of played outcomes included in the express (if on one of the bets included in the express occurs a return, then the coefficient on it equals to 1). ",
  "p5_1__2": "“System” – a set of “express bets” of a particular set of events. Each combination of the system is calculated as a separate express bet. To win in the system it is sufficient that the indicated number of predictions of the total number be correct (it is defined by name, that is, for example, in the system “3 of 4′′ it is necessary that 3 of the 4 predictions prove correct, for “5 of 7′′ it is necessary properly to predict the outcome of the five events of 7 options, etc.). It must be taken into account that because of the fact that only a part of the total bet amount is specified on each of the express of the system bet (proportional to the number of options) then the winnings by such a system bet will be less than the possible general winnings by the express bet. In some cases, when not all outcomes are predicted, the amount of winnings may be less than the amount of the bet, but in contrast to express bets, a part of the amount will be offset on account of correctly predicted outcomes. ",
  "p5_1__3": "“Chain” – bet which is a combination of “single” bets including events independent from each other. The sum of single bet of chain‘s each event is equal to the sum of chain. The client is given a chance to determine independently the order of the bets included in the chain and stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus the concept of “chain account” is imported. After the tournament of each single bet included in the chain the sum of that account is calculated. Initially it is equal to the sum of the first bet. If the sum on the chain account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s next event’s single bet is calculated by the account balance. The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on the order of bets mentioned in the given ticket but not on time. The sum which remains on the account after calculation of all bets in the chain is a subject to payment. ",
  "p5_1__4": "If the sum on the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is considered to be lost.",
  "p5_1__5": "“Handicap” – the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of competition, expressed in goals (points/) sets, etc., which is provided by the bookmaker office to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the event subject to the handicap is determined in this way: the handicap given to the entrant is added to the corresponding result shown by the entrant in the competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of the elected entrant, he is considered as a winner, and the bets on his win subject to the handicap win. Payments are carried out with the coefficient of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the result is in favor of the opponent – the bets are lost. If the result subject to the handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a result will be equal to 1 (return of the bet); ",

To win with the bet on the handicap “+1.5′′ it is necessary that Cagliari will not lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5 will be added to goals from Cagliari. Let us analyze all the options:",
  "p5_1_1_A": "* A) Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of 1 goal. For example, the final score is 2-1.

  "p5_1_2__1": "Double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or total taking into account the handicap, which is the multiple of 0.25 (but not of 0.5). Such bets are calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum: with the same odd and “common handicaps” and “common totals” multiple of 0.5’s nearby common value. In case when the Asian handicap is included in parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in case of single bet. In case of winning of two common bets, the bet’s odd “O” is taken into account in the calculations. If one common bet is won and the other is a subject to refund, during the calculation is taken the odd (“O”+1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet considered lost.",
