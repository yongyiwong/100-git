  "p1_2": "100Bet’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects of problem gambling and to promote responsible gambling practices.",
  "p1_3": "100Bet provides online customers with a wide range of games and entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up. The aim of 100Bet is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for adults. The products and services allow each user to play within his/her financial means and receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding principles for 100Bet. It is therefore clear that 100Bet should do its best to assist those customers that show signs of suffering from problem gambling, particularly in those cases of immoderate playing. At the same time, it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in games of chance to a reasonable extent and treat it as a form of entertainment.",

  "h2": "Player security",

Protection of the players is based on preventing under age players from participating in games and the protection of privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organisations. Marketing communications are also created with player protection and fairness in mind.",
  "h3": "Protection against problem gambling: research – prevention – intervention",
  "p3_1": "The majority of gamblers who place sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation for entertainment. Certain habits and behaviour patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) that are considered to be normal and are not any cause for concern, can develop into addiction for some people and cause them problems. In the same way, betting on sports and gambling in general can lead to problems for a small percentage of customers.",

  "h4": "Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention",
  "p4_1": "The basic principle promoted by 100Bet is to create a safe and responsible online environment where customers can enjoy their betting experience. Whilst 100Bet can provide tools to assist customers to control their gambling, self-responsibility of the customer plays a large part in using the tools we offer and is the most effective form of protection from problem gambling. 100Bet sees its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent products, tools to control gambling and full information on where customers experiencing problems with their gambling can find professional advice and support.",

In order to offer the best possible protection of minors, 100Bet also relies on the support of their parents and caregivers. 100Bet advises its customers to keep their data for account access in a safe place (user ID and password) and to not disclose this data to anyone.",
  "h6": "Responsibility towards problems",
  "p6_1": "100Bet offers a variety of games and bets which are forms of entertainment for the majority of customers. At the same time, the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment, taking into account the associated risks.",
  "p6_2": "Clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer from problem gambling are potentially not able to enjoy the product line-up responsibly and do not perceive it as a form of entertainment. 100Bet may take responsibility for these users by blocking their access to certain products for their own protection.",
  "h7": "Be informed about the main issues!",
  "p7_1": "Most people play for pleasure and enjoy moderate participation in games within their financial capacity. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment and this is a challenge that must be considered seriously.",
  "h8": "What is the problematic gambling behaviour?",

It is defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of professional growth.",
  "h9": "What type of gambling behaviours can be considered problematic?",
  "p9_1": "Whilst the diagnoses of problem gambling can only be qualified by experts, the material presented on this web-page will help customers estimate and define their own gambling behaviour.",
  "p9_2": "Addictions that are not associated with any substance are very difficult to define the line between pleasure and problem. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic signals that may indicate existing issues. Customers that experience at least five of the following symptoms are more likely to be suffering from problem gambling:",

  "p10_5": "Once setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.",

  "p10_7": "Do not play under the influence of alcohol or drugs.",
  "p10_8": "Do not gamble when you are depressed or upset, decision making can be more difficult when you are stressed or emotionally upset."
